> I was banned on Twitter yet again and I refuse to continue making accounts if it takes a single report to get banned now.

One of the most welcoming instances with plenty of other services, light politics with a shit ton of memes and lewd anime babes. <br>
Be kind to SJW and the other admin, very few rules so if you manage to get banned from here you won't be welcome in most instances.


### Future Plans
As time goes on I will continue using the Fediverse as I am completely unbannable (depending on what instance hosts me) luckily I am on two amazing instances. <br>
I will love for you all to join me on the Fediverse through any providers you love most. Be sure to check the about tab and follow the rules of your instance to avoid being banned.
