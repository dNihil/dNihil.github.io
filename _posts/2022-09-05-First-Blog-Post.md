This is my new website and I plan to make it my own self hosted link thing place.. kinda

I kinda just started this project for fun so I am trying to make it worth my time, but I doubt I will upload videos here etc because of space restrictions, so MAYBE I will do blog posts with embed videos from Rumble or something.

For starters, you can find ALL of my links on the Links page at the top of the homepage. You can also click [here](https://dnihil.github.io/homepage/links/) to find the page.
