### My story

I became inspired to make videos when I was really young, I watched PewDiePie every day almost with his Happy Wheel and Amnesia videos. 

I made my first ever YouTube when I was 11 years old, I reacted to 2 Girls 1 Cup (yeah i know, i had no idea what scat was). 

Ever since my first channel failed completely, I decided to try gaming videos, I recorded Fallout New Vegas from my Xbox 360 to my Sidekick propped up on my tshirt. 

**Humble Beginnings**

Flash forward to 2016, I became a competitive COD player winning a total of $20 in MLG games. Along with being the leader of a Rainbow Six Siege Pro Team. I thought being a Pro would be the same and honestly it was awful, I hated sweating in games that I just wanted to mess around on. I lost all enjoyment in my career. 

Around 2018 I was BACK, abandoning the Pro Leagues and focusing on content creation, at the time I didn't have any editing software and I was playing on a potato PC I got for $550 at BestBuy. I was still recording clips from gaming and using an editor on my phone for music videos and everything! During this time, I wanted to expand my content into more than just clips on Instagram and random shitposts on Twitter. With all of the money I made at work, saving up I bought a better mic and headset and I invested in the Adobe Suite to start making proper content.

It has been a very long time coming since my [first edited video](https://youtu.be/i9J64K8dVEM) in 2020. Yes, it took a very long time to learn Premiere and get used to editing and I was still dogass at it back then too. Never used keyframes, had no text animations, and didn't even have an intro yet. I loved making content even though it was only being seen by 12 people. I really started investing all of time into it, I made my own intro, thumbnails, and I was networking a lot to get viewers, sponsors, and friends to make content with. 

It's 2022, I have been making videos for almost 8 years. I don't even have 100 subs, and I have only made 25 cents from Ad Revenue, but I still love making content for the laughs and the whole process is just so enjoyable even to complain about I like it.

Thanks to all my viewers for giving my content a try in the first place, I don't have to know your names to appreciate you all. You all motivate me to keep doing <3
