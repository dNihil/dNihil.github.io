### My story

I became inspired to make videos when I was really young, I watched PewDiePie every day almost with his Happy Wheel and Amnesia videos. 

I made my first ever YouTube when I was 11 years old, I reacted to 2 Girls 1 Cup (yeah i know, i had no idea what scat was). 

Ever since my first channel failed completely, I decided to try gaming videos, I recorded Fallout New Vegas from my Xbox 360 to my Sidekick propped up on my tshirt. 

**Humble Beginnings**

Flash forward to 2016, I became a competitive COD player winning a total of $20 in MLG games. Along with being the leader of a Rainbow Six Siege Pro Team. I thought being a Pro would be the same and honestly it was awful, I hated sweating in games that I just wanted to mess around on. I lost all enjoyment in my career. 

Around 2018 I was BACK, abandoning the Pro Leagues and focusing on content creation, at the time I didn't have any editing software and I was playing on a potato PC I got for $550 at BestBuy. I was still recording clips from gaming and using an editor on my phone for music videos and everything!
